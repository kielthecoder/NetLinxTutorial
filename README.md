# NetLinxTutorial

Learn the NetLinx programming language with this quick tutorial.  You can follow along with the posts at <https://kielthecoder.com/tag/netlinx/>.

In this series, we'll build a small NetLinx program that incorporates a touchpanel and a couple of controllable devices.  Equipment you'll need to follow along:
 * Any NI-series controller (I'm using an NI-3100)
 * Any G4-series touchpanel (I'm using an MVP-9000)
